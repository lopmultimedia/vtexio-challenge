# Header ðŸ’»
The header is the top part of the web pages of a site. In an eCommerce, in the header you will find the brand logo, the navigation menu, the search engine, access to your account and shopping cart and other links with access to different pages of the site.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed header. To do this we want to see how you perform with the "Header" component. The menu CTAs must go to the department with the id "1" (/tecnologia).

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, the menu has a single level when you tap on the hamburger menu
