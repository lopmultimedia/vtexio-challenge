# Footer 💻
The Footer is the bottom part of a site's web pages. In an eCommerce, in the Footer you will find the brand logo, the navigation menu to different sections of the site, registration for the brand's newsletter and access to social networks.

## Exercise 📢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed footer. To do this we want to see how you perform with the "Footer" component. The menu CTAs must go to the department with the id "5" (/mujer).

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.** 

### Mobile version
