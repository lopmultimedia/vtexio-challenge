# Product page ðŸ’»
A Product description page is the product itself, where you can see the specific details of the product and add the product to the cart.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Product page. To do this we want to see how it performs with the "Basic" and "Store" components. 

- The product you have to use is the one called "TV NOBLEX 43 LED DK43X5100 SMART FHD" with product id "7" and its URL is "/tv-noblex-43-led-dk43x5100-smart-fhd/p"

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.**
