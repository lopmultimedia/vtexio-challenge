# Products slider ðŸ’»
A Product Slider is a listing of products. This block can be found mostly on the home page and product page where additional products are recommended.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Product Slider. To do this we want to see how it performs with the "Slider layout" and "Product Summary" components. 

- The collection you have to use is the one called "All" with the id "142"
- The collection for the "free shipping" label that you have to use is the one called "Free Shipping" with the id "139"
- The collection for the "SALE" label that you have to use is the one called "Free Shipping" with the id "145"

Add this block in position 3 of the page called "Challenge" with the URL /exercise

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.**
