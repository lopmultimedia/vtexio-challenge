# Banner 💻
A banner, or more formally web banner, is an advertising format on the Internet. It is a type of advertisement that is generally used in so-called display advertising, advertising pieces with graphic content that are located on different web pages. There are different formats for both desktop and mobile sizes.

## Exercise 📢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Banner. For this we want to see how you perform in using native components to develop it.

Banner CTAs should be directed to the "All" collection with id "142" and opened in a new window.

Add this block in position 2 of the page called "Challenge" with the URL /exercise

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, in the first grid, 3 banners must be placed and they work with a slider. For the second row, there are 2 still images, one below the other.
