A text block is additional information on a page that helps the user understand the information they are about to view.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the proposed design. To do this we want to see how it performs with the "Rich Text" component. We ask that the title be an H1 and the text a paragraph.

Add this block in position 1 of the page called "Challenge" with the URL /exercise

**The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient.**
